API rate limiting

1. Leaky Bucket rate limiting (Video processing app -> sequence by sequence video process hoti hai)
Constant processing (2 request per second)
Stable traffic control
Simple
Have constant capacity of queue

2. Token rate limiting (All operators are busy, please wait for some time -> aisa bolta hai jio operator)
Have constant capacity of queue

3. Fixed window rate limiting (Threshold)
constant = 5 request / minute
Request may increase in window boundary

4. Sliding window log
=> Dynamic window which get shifted (Solved the boundary issue)
Window - 3 request/sec
