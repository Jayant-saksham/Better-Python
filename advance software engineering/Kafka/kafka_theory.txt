## Kafka ##
Video upload on YouTube -> Server sends back the response to the client an acknowledgment that I have received that video
All the process like copyright check, converting into resolution etc happen behind the scenes
(This process is called asycn (process happening parallely)

1. Producer pushes the event in kafka queue
2. Consumer subscribe to a topic and consume the data

So any parallel work => Push it into a Kafka queue
